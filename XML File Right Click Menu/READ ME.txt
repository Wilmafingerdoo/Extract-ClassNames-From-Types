1)	Put the "TypesToClassnames.bat" file in a folder of your choice,
2)	Open "AddExtractTypesRightClick.reg" file in a text editor,
3)	Change the path in there to the path of the file above,
Optional: you can change the text that is displayed when you right click the xml files.
4)	Once changed save and open the "AddExtractTypesRightClick.reg" file it will add it to the registry.

You will then be able to right click on a types file (it will be there for any xml file) and select "Extract ClassName From Types" (on windows 11 you may need to press "show more options" first)
it will then create a file with the original name followed by _Classnames.txt containing all the classnames from the types.

if you where to try again on the same types it will give an error telling you the file already exists (unless you have deleted it of course)
