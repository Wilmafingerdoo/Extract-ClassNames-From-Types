Drag and drop a types file onto the "TypesToClassnames.bat" file (in this version it must be named "types.xml")
This version if the "types.xml" file is in the same folder as the "TypesToClassnames.bat" you can just double click it instead of drag and drop.
it will then create a file in the "types.xml" folder with the name types_ClassNames.txt containing all the classnames from the types. 

if types_ClassNames.txt already exists in the folder with the types file it will give an error telling you the file already exists.
