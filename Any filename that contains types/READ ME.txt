Drag and drop a types file onto the "TypesToClassnames.bat" file (in this version it can be any xml with types in the name)
it will then create a file in the original files folder with the name types_ClassNames.txt containing all the classnames from the types. 
If you drop more than one types on it at the same time the classnames will be put into one file

if types_ClassNames.txt already exists in the folder with the types file it will give an error telling you the file already exists.
